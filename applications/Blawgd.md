## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Create a censorship resistant blogging platform on the blockchain similar to the likes of twitter and koo.

### Overview

Blawgd is similar to other microblogging platforms such as twitter and koo in its usage however 
it greatly differs from them in its inner workings. The other popular microblogging platform 
store data on their servers which are controlled by them giving them complete 
control of what goes on in their platform. This makes it very easy for owners of the platform to 
control what the user sees and is allowed to say on their platform. They are able to ban anyone they 
want and artificially improve visibility of opinions they favor.

The blawgd platform on the other hand is controlled by various entities such as stakeholders of the blockchain network and client authors making it very hard for any one party to influence the behaviour of the platform. The blawgd platform is divided into the network and the clients. The network stores all the data and the client verifies the data queried from the network.

The blawgd network is controlled by stake holders of the blockchain network using proof of stake. Any malicious change to the network has to be voted on by a majority of stakeholders democratically which makes it hard for any one party to censor information.

The blawgd clients are created by various client authors and will be open source. Any malicious change to the client has to be made by the author of the client and will be immediately detected by the community since its open source. Since each client will be used by fraction of the user base any potential censorship for a period of time will have insignificant influence over the platform.

### Project Details

Data is stored on chain and clients can be assured that data has not been censored using merkle proofs.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Blawgd would be blockchain application on polkadot built with substrate.
* We aim to acquire the users of gab.com and a sizeable chunk of political users on twitter
* Cant find any application similar to this in polkadot/kusama/substrate ecosystem
