## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Create a censorship resistant blogging platform on the blockchain similar to the likes of twitter and koo.

### Overview

Blawgd is similar to other microblogging platforms such as twitter and koo in its usage however 
it greatly differs from them in its inner workings. 

The other popular microblogging platform 
store data on their servers which are controlled by them giving them complete 
control of what goes on in their platform. This makes it very easy for owners of the platform to 
control what the user sees and is allowed to say on their platform. They are able to ban anyone they 
want and artificially improve visibility of opinions they favor.

The Blawgd platform is not controlled by any single entity and hence is very hard to influence. Users cannot be banned or censored providing a platform
that truly protects the freedom of speech of its users.

### Project Details

Data is stored on chain and clients can be assured that data has not been censored using merkle proofs.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Blawgd would be blockchain application on polkadot built with substrate.
* This platform is aimed at any user that values their freedom of speech.
* Cant find any application similar to this in polkadot/kusama/substrate ecosystem
